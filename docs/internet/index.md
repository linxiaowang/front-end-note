## What is internet?

Internet is a network of networks, and network means a group of computers or other devices which area connected to each other.

## How internet works
Internet uses a variety of protocols including the Internet Protocol(IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol(TCP).
IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination,
TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order

### Some other technologies and protocols
Domain Name System(DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP), and the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security(SSL/TLS) protocol.

## Basic Concepts and Terminology

Packet: A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet
Router: A device that directs packets of data between different networks
IP Address: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to correct destination
Domain Name: A human-readable name that is used to identify a website such as google.com
DNS: The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
HTTPS: An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.
SSL/TLS: The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet.

## Understanding IP Addresses and Domain Names

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It’s used to route data to the correct destination, ensuring that information is sent to the intended recipient. IP addresses are typically represented as a series of four numbers separated by periods, such as “192.168.1.1”.

Domain names, on the other hand, are human-readable names used to identify websites and other internet resources. They’re typically composed of two or more parts, separated by periods. For example, “google.com” is a domain name. Domain names are translated into IP addresses using the Domain Name System (DNS).

DNS is a critical part of the internet infrastructure, responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which returns the corresponding IP address. Your computer then uses that IP address to connect to the website or other resource you’ve requested.
